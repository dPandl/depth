## dePth - Your Personal Digital Diary (Social Media Style)
Welcome to dePth, a unique digital diary application designed with a social media-inspired interface. It allows you to document your thoughts, experiences, images, and videos in a familiar and engaging format.

This app is heavily inspired by and pays homage to "mine" by masterpose, a brilliant concept found at https://masterpose.itch.io/mine. I've taken that core idea and brought it to life as a web application, providing a seamless and intuitive way to capture your daily moments.
